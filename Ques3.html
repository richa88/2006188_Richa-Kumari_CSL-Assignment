    <H2>Combinators in CSS</H2>
    <p class="content">Combinators are some concept which is used to explain the association or connection among the selectors.</p>
    <p class="content">There are four special combinators provided by CSS:</p>
    <article>
        <ol>
            <li>General sibling selector (~)</li>
            <li>Descendant selector (space)</li>
            <li>Child selector (>)</li>
            <li>Adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
        </ol>
       </article>
<div class="all">
    <div class="first">
        <H3>General sibling selector</H3>
        <p>It is implemented for selecting the element that trails the initial or first selector element and shares the same parent as the first selector element. The general sibling selector is explicitly implemented for choosing a group of elements allocated for the same parent element.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
        <H3>Descendant selector </H3>
        <p>This selector is implemented to select every child element within the particular tag mentioned in the CSS selector section. The tags may be of the direct child of any specific tag or extremely deep within the particular tag.We can also use an article tag for this purpose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="third">
        <H3>Child selector</H3>
        <p>It is implemented for selecting that particular element that lies within the immediate child of that specific tag. It is more precise or exact than the descendant selector since it chooses only the second selector if it has the first selector element as its parent.We can also select the Nth child.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="fourth">
        <H3>Adjacent sibling selector</H3>
        <p>This selector is implemented for selecting all those elements, which are the contiguous or neighboring siblings of a particular element. Here, the sibling elements ought to have the identical parent element as well as "adjacent," i.e., "immediately following".Both the elements must share same parent.</p>
